# Vision Statement
In the world of MMA and Boxing, methods of training combat have been the same for decades. Often times there will be a stationary punching bag or dummy, and sometimes personal trainers if you are lucky. However during a global pandemic this is even more unlikely. The solution is an individual training system made for all levels of fighters. DUM (Defensive Unlearned Machine) is a moving punch pad aided by AI and computer vision. Using the DUM app, you can choose what level of difficulty that DUM will perform and DUM will move accordingly, creating a challenging high-paced workout. The app not only tracks how many times you hit the bag, but what type of hit you threw, whether that be jab, straight, or uppercut. Practice pre-selected combinations and DUM's AI will tell you if you have thrown the correct punches. Not only does this eliminate the monotony of stationary punching bags but helps increase the users skill and accuracy more than a standard dummy.
