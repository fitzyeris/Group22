# Program Organization

The architecture for this project consists of a robotic boxing dummy as well as the Deffensive Unlearned Machine(DUM) web application we will be developing in this course.

### Context Diagram
The context diagram displays the relationship between the user, our DUM system and our robot.

### Container Diagram
The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

### Component Diagram
The Component diagram shows how a container is made up of a number of "components", what each of those components are, their responsibilities and the technology/implementation details.

# Code Design

You should have your UML Class diagram and any other useful UML diagrams in this section. Each diagram should be accompanied by a brief description explaining what the elements are and why they are in the diagram. For your class diagram, you must also include a table that relates each class to one or more user stories.

# Data Design
The data from users will store in database to help to train AI to improve recognize fist better and number of punches.

If you are using a database, you should have a basic Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in this section. This diagram should describe the tables in your database and their relationship to one another (especially primary/foreign keys), including the columns within each table.

# Business Rules

You should list the assumptions, rules, and guidelines from external sources that are impacting your program design.

You should have one or more user interface screens in this section. Each screen should be accompanied by an explaination of the screens purpose and how the user will interact with it. You should relate each screen to one another as the user transitions through the states of your application. You should also have a table that relates each window or component to the support using stories.
